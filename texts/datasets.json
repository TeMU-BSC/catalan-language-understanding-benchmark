All the commissioned annotators of these datasets (1) were native speakers of Catalan, (2) with a background on translation, edition, philology, or linguistics, and (3) had previous experience in language-related tasks. The curation rationale we followed was to make these datasets both representative of contemporary Catalan language, as well as directly comparable to similar reference datasets from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark. Since our datasets are desgined for Machine Learning and Language Modelling, we have provided training, evaluation and tests splits at HuggingFace. In what follows, we describe these datasets.", "id": "data_statement"},

It contains more than 3,000 sentence pairs, annotated with their semantic similarity using a scale from 0 (no similarity at all) to 5 (semantic equivalence).\nTo develop STS-ca, we pre-selected potential sentence pairs from the CaText corpus by using different similarity measures (Jaccard, Doc2Vec and DistilBERT embedding cosine similarity). We did a final manual review to ensure that the selection represented superficial and deep similarities in subject matter and lexicon. Following the guidelines set in the SemEval challenges, we commissioned 4 native speaker annotators from 2 independent companies to assess the similarity of the sentence pairs on a scale between 0 (completely dissimilar) to 5 (completely equivalent), with other possible values, such as 3 (roughly equivalent, but some important information differs). Then, for each sentence pair, we computed the mean of the four annotations, and we discarded single annotations that deviate by more than 1 from the mean. After this filtering process, we used the mean of the remaining annotations as a final score. Finally, in order to assess the quality of the dataset, we measured the correlation of each annotator’s labels with the average of the rest of the annotators, and averaged all the individual correlations, resulting in a Pearson correlation of 0.739.", "id": "sts", "link": "https://huggingface.co/datasets/projecte-aina/sts-ca"},

We randomly chose 18,000 sentences from these sources, and filtered them by different criteria, such as length and stand-alone intelligibility. From the remaining text sentences, we commissioned 3 hypotheses (one for each entailment category) to be written by a team of annotators.
