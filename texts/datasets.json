For example, gender and socioeconomic status are considered not as relevant for the kind of semantic annotations created. However, the fact that all commissioned annotators (1) were native speakers of Catalan, (2) were translators, editors, philologists or linguists, and (3) had previous experience in language-related tasks, is considered to be important. The curation rationale we follow was to make these datasets both representative of contemporary Catalan language use, as well as directly comparable to similar reference datasets from the General Language Understanding Evaluation (GLUE) benchmark. Since our datasets are geared towards Machine Learning and Language Modelling, we have provided training, evaluation and tests splits at HuggingFace. In what follows, we describe some of these datasets."},

It contains more than 3000 sentence pairs, annotated with their semantic similarity using a scale from 0 (no similarity at all) to 5 (semantic equivalence).\nTo develop STS-ca, we pre-selected potential sentence pairs from the CaText corpus by using different similarity measures (Jaccard, Doc2Vec and DistilBERT embedding cosine similarity). We did a final manual review to ensure that the selection represented superficial and deep similarities in subject matter and lexicon. Following the guidelines set in the SemEval challenges, we commissioned 4 native speaker annotators from 2 independent companies to assess the similarity of the sentence pairs on a scale between 0 (completely dissimilar) to 5 (completely equivalent), with other possible values, such as 3 (roughly equivalent, but some important information differs). Then, for each sentence pair, we computed the mean of the four annotations, and we discarded single annotations that deviate by more than 1 from the mean. After this filtering process, we used the mean of the remaining annotations as a final score. Finally, in order to assess the quality of the dataset, we measured the correlation of each annotator’s labels with the average of the rest of the annotators, and averaged all the individual correlations, resulting in a Pearson correlation of 0.739."},

We extracted Named Entities from the original AnCora version, filtering out some unconventional ones, like book titles, and transcribe them into a standard CONLL-IOB format. The AnCora corpus has been released recently under CC-BY licence, and we published our derivative version under the same licence."},

From a the online edition of the catalan newspaper Vilaweb, 2095 article headlines were randomnly selected. These headlines were also used to create the Textual Entailment dataset (TECa). For the extractive QA dataset, creation of between 1 and 5 questions for each news context was commissioned to a team of native speakers. In total, 6282 pairs of a question and an extracted fragment that contains the answer were created."},

Textual Entailment is considered an important evaluation of the ability of a model to incorporate some measure of inferential capabilities, as opposed to make do with a prodigious memory of what it has actually seen before. TECa contains more than 20000 pairs of sentences annotated with their relation label, that can be 0 (neutral), 1 (inference) or 2 (contradiction).\nWe randomly chose 18000 sentences from those sources, and filtered them by different criteria, such as length and stand-alone intelligibility. From the remaining text sentences, we commissioned 3 hypotheses (one for each entailment category) to be written by a team of annotators. We obtained more than 20000 annotated sentence pairs, which are published under CC-by licence. From 600 randomly selected samples we cross-annotated for Quality Assurance, and obtained an inter-annotator agreement of 83,57%."},

We used the subsection category asa classification label, after excluding territorial labels and labels with less than 2000 occurrences.
